       <p>Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report from MacRumors, <br>code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15<br> Pro and Pro Max models.<br>
        Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple <br>Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking your<br> device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, beginning a<br> workout and turning on your flashlight.</p>
