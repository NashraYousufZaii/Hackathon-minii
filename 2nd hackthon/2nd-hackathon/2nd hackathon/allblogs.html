       <p>Elon Musk - August 17th, 2023</p>
       </p>
       <p>Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and  <br> multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset <br>  leads to improved robustness to accents,  background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables  <br> transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open- <br> sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further <br> research on robust speech processing.</p>

       <p> Inzamam Malik - August 16th, 2023</p>
       </p>
       <p>Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report from MacRumors, <br>code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15<br> Pro and Pro Max models.<br>
        Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple <br>Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking your<br> device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, beginning a<br> workout and turning on your flashlight.
